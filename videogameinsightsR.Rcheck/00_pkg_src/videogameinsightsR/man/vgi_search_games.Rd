Defaults to the VGI_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.}

\description{
Search for games by title using the Video Game Insights database.
Since the new API doesn't have a dedicated search endpoint, this function
fetches the game list and performs client-side filtering.
}
\details{
This function now uses the \verb{/games/game-list} endpoint and filters results
locally. For better performance with large datasets, consider caching the
game list.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Ensure the VGI_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable is set
# Sys.setenv(VGI_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_auth_token_here")

# Search for games with "valve" in the title
valve_games <- vgi_search_games("valve")
print(valve_games)

# Search with more results
rpg_games <- vgi_search_games("rpg", limit = 50)
}
