\title{Get Top Countries by Player Count}
\usage{
vgi_top_countries(
  steam_app_id,
  auth_token = Sys.getenv("VGI_AUTH_TOKEN"),
  headers = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{steam_app_id}{Integer. The Steam App ID of the game.}

\item{auth_token}{Character string. Your VGI API authentication token.
Defaults to the VGI_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.}

\item{headers}{List. Optional custom headers to include in the API request.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{country}{Character. Two-letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)}
\item{countryName}{Character. Full country name}
\item{playerCount}{Integer. Number of players from this country}
\item{percentage}{Numeric. Percentage of total player base}
\item{rank}{Integer. Country rank by player count}
}
}
\description{
Retrieve the top countries by player count for a specific game, showing
where the game's player base is concentrated geographically.
}
\details{
This endpoint provides insights into:
\itemize{
\item Geographic distribution of your player base
\item Key markets for localization efforts
\item Regional marketing opportunities
\item Server location planning
}

Countries are ranked by total player count, typically showing
the top 20-50 countries depending on the game's distribution.
