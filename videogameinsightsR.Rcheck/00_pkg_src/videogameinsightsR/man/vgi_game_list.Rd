\title{Get Complete Game List}
\usage{
vgi_game_list(auth_token = Sys.getenv("VGI_AUTH_TOKEN"), headers = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{auth_token}{Character string. Your VGI API authentication token.
Defaults to the VGI_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.}

\item{headers}{List. Optional custom headers to include in the API request.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Integer. The Steam App ID}
\item{name}{Character. The game name}
}
}
\description{
Retrieve a list of all games available in the Video Game Insights database.
This is a lightweight endpoint that returns game IDs and names only.
}
\details{
This endpoint is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Getting a complete inventory of tracked games
\item Building game selection interfaces
\item Caching game names for ID lookups
\item Validating game IDs before making other API calls
}

Note: This endpoint may return thousands of games. Consider caching
the results locally to avoid repeated API calls.

\dontrun{
# Get all games
all_games <- vgi_game_list()
cat("Total games in database:", nrow(all_games), "\n")

# Search for games by name
cs_games <- all_games[grep("Counter-Strike", all_games$name, ignore.case = TRUE), ]
print(cs_games)

# Find game ID by exact name
game_id <- all_games$id[all_games$name == "Counter-Strike 2"]
if (length(game_id) > 0) {
  cat("Counter-Strike 2 ID:", game_id, "\n")
}

# Get random sample of games for analysis
sample_games <- all_games[sample(nrow(all_games), 10), ]
print(sample_games)

# Cache results for future use
saveRDS(all_games, "vgi_game_list_cache.rds")
# Later: all_games <- readRDS("vgi_game_list_cache.rds")
}
