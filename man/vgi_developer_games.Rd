\title{Get Game IDs by Developer}
\usage{
vgi_developer_games(
  company_id,
  auth_token = Sys.getenv("VGI_AUTH_TOKEN"),
  headers = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{company_id}{Integer. The developer's company ID.}

\item{auth_token}{Character string. Your VGI API authentication token.
Defaults to the VGI_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.}

\item{headers}{List. Optional custom headers to include in the API request.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of Steam App IDs for games developed by this company.
}
\description{
Retrieve a list of Steam App IDs for all games by a specific developer.
}
\details{
This endpoint now returns only game IDs instead of full game metadata.
To get detailed information about each game, use \code{vgi_game_metadata()}
with the returned IDs.

This approach is more efficient when you only need to:
\itemize{
\item Count the number of games by a developer
\item Check if a developer made a specific game
\item Get a subset of games for detailed analysis
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get all game IDs for a developer
game_ids <- vgi_developer_games(company_id = 24569)

# Count games by this developer
cat("Total games:", length(game_ids), "\n")

# Get detailed info for the first 5 games
if (length(game_ids) > 0) {
  first_five <- head(game_ids, 5)
  game_details <- lapply(first_five, vgi_game_metadata)
  
  # Display game names
  for (game in game_details) {
    cat(game$name, "(", game$steamAppId, ")\n")
  }
}

# Check if developer made a specific game
target_game_id <- 730
if (target_game_id \%in\% game_ids) {
  cat("Yes, this developer made game", target_game_id, "\n")
}

# Analyze developer's recent releases
if (length(game_ids) > 0) {
  # Get metadata for all games
  all_games <- vgi_game_metadata_batch(game_ids)
  
  # Find games released in last 2 years
  recent_games <- all_games[
    as.Date(all_games$releaseDate) > Sys.Date() - 730,
  ]
  
  cat("Games released in last 2 years:", nrow(recent_games), "\n")
}
}
}
