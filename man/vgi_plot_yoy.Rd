}
\arguments{
\item{yoy_comparison}{A vgi_yoy_comparison object from vgi_game_summary_yoy()}

\item{metric}{Character string. Which metric to plot: "ccu", "revenue", "units"}

\item{type}{Character string. Plot type: "line" (time series), "bar" (totals),
or "growth" (YoY growth percentages)}

\item{games}{Character vector. Specific game names to include. If NULL,
includes all games.}
