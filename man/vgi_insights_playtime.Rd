\title{Get Playtime Statistics for a Game}
\usage{
vgi_insights_playtime(
  steam_app_id,
  auth_token = Sys.getenv("VGI_AUTH_TOKEN"),
  headers = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{steam_app_id}{Integer. The Steam App ID of the game.}

\item{auth_token}{Character string. Your VGI API authentication token.
Defaults to the VGI_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.}

\item{headers}{List. Optional custom headers to include in the API request.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{steamAppId}{Integer. The Steam App ID}
\item{avgPlaytime}{Integer. Average lifetime playtime across all users (in minutes)}
\item{medianPlaytime}{Integer. Median lifetime playtime across all users (in minutes)}
\item{avgPlaytimeRank}{Integer. Rank of the game by average playtime}
\item{avgPlaytimePrct}{Numeric. Percentile of average playtime}
\item{playtimeRanges}{Data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item range: Character string describing the playtime range (e.g., "0", "<2", "2-5", "5-10", etc.)
\item percentage: Percentage of players in this range
}
}
}
}
\description{
Retrieve detailed playtime statistics for a specific game, including average and median
playtime, ranking information, and distribution across playtime ranges.
}
\details{
The playtime data is returned in minutes. To convert to hours, divide by 60.

Playtime ranges help understand player engagement patterns:
\itemize{
\item "0": Players who own but never played
\item "<2": Players who tried briefly (under 2 hours)
\item "2-5": Short engagement
\item "5-10": Moderate engagement
\item "10-20": Good engagement
\item "20-50": Strong engagement
\item "50-100": Very engaged players
\item "100-200": Highly engaged players
\item "200-500": Dedicated players
\item "500+": Extremely dedicated players
}
}
