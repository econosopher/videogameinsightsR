# Video Game Insights API Investigation Summary

## Executive Summary

The Video Game Insights API is currently **unusable for modern game analytics**. After extensive testing and updating the R package to match the API specification exactly, fundamental issues prevent getting current game data.

## Key Findings

### 1. API Specification Compliance ✅
- Updated `vgi_game_rankings()` to only accept `offset` and `limit` parameters
- Updated `vgi_game_list()` to accept no parameters (as per spec)
- Updated `vgi_active_players_by_date()` to include `offset` and `limit`
- Removed all non-existent parameters (genre, platform, date filtering)

### 2. Data Quality Issues ❌

#### Rankings Endpoint (`/games/rankings`)
- **Returns only**: Games with Steam IDs 10-17740
- **These are**: Old Valve games from 2004-2007
- **Missing**: All modern games (CS2, PUBG, Apex Legends, etc.)
- **Parameters ignored**: Date ranges have no effect

#### Active Players Endpoint (`/engagement/active-players/{date}`)
- **Same issue**: Only returns old games
- **Max game ID**: 17740
- **No modern games**: Despite requesting July 2025 data

#### Metadata Endpoint (`/games/{id}/metadata`)
- **Individual lookups work**: Can fetch CS2 (730), PUBG (578080), Apex (1172470)
- **But returns malformed data**: "All columns in a tibble must be vectors" error
- **Batch endpoint broken**: Cannot fetch multiple games at once

### 3. Missing Functionality

The API lacks:
- Server-side genre filtering
- Platform filtering
- Date-based filtering that actually works
- Modern game data in list/ranking endpoints
- The analytics endpoints mentioned in documentation (404 errors)

## Impact on Original Request

**Original Goal**: Get top 10 shooters by weekly active users

**Current Reality**: 
- Cannot get DAU/WAU for modern games
- Cannot filter by genre (Shooter)
- Cannot get current rankings
- API only returns 20-year-old games

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Needs
1. **Use Excel/CSV exports** from the Video Game Insights website
2. **Build local cache** of known game IDs and metadata
3. **Use alternative data sources** for current game metrics

### For API Provider
1. **Update data ingestion** to include games newer than 2007
2. **Fix endpoint responses** to match specification
3. **Implement filtering** that actually works
4. **Update documentation** to reflect current limitations

### For R Package Users
1. **Don't rely on API** for current game analytics
2. **Use caching** to minimize API calls
3. **Expect warnings** about old game data
4. **Check game IDs** - if all < 1000, data is stale

## Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework has been created:
- `test_api_spec_compliance.R` - Validates parameters against spec
- `test_endpoint_validation.R` - Checks data quality
- `run_api_diagnostics.R` - Generates full diagnostic report

Run diagnostics with:
```r
source("R/run_api_diagnostics.R")
```

## Conclusion

The Video Game Insights API is currently not suitable for production use in analyzing modern gaming trends. The API returns a static dataset of games from 2004-2007, making any analysis of current market conditions impossible. Until these fundamental issues are resolved, users should rely on alternative data sources.
